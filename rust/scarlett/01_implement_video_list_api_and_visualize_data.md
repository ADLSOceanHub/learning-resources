Six years later, I'm finally starting to work on this MR https://github.com/ADLSOceanHub/OceanHub/issues/14.


I'm going to use Rust. Is this some sort of self punishment for not working on the MR? Could be, and that's okay. 

Will learn the following from working on the MR:
- Tree structures in HTML DOM
    - Rust webscraping library: [Scraper crate](https://docs.rs/scraper/0.19.0/scraper/)
- Will a [6 year old Python library still work?](https://github.com/tjcrone/pycamhd) 
    - If so, learn how Python libraries can be used in Rust with [PyO3](https://pyo3.rs/v0.22.1/)
    - If not, understand what the initial library was doing and see if a rewrite needs to happen
